### Nixie Tube Clock

Nixie Tube Clock with wireless NTP syncing.

This project is split into three boards.  One for the nixie clock display, one for the shift registers and high voltage transistors to drive the nixies, and a control board that has the MCU and power supplies for the entire board (including the high voltage needed by the nixie tubes).

Here is a **photo mode** png of each of the boards:
